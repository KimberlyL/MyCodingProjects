# MyCodingProjects
##A collection of some small coding projects I've built.

###Thanks for checking out my projects!

The first two projects are both microcontroller projects.

They were programmed, built, and techincal documents were written for each project in about two hours. 

####The RGB LED Rainbow 
	* This is a project used to teach kids between the ages 8 to 16 about STEM.
	* Uses an Ardunio Uno as an AVR In System Programmer
	* Uses an ATtiny45 8-pin IC to program RGB LEDs

####The LED Equalizer
	* This is a audio spectrum analyser
	* Uses a Tiva C Series, a sound sensor, and a ton of LEDs
	* Uses threshold values and interrupts to reflect auditory levels 

This Space Ship version of Flappy Bird app was built in about 6 hours without any prior app builiding experience

####The Space Ship (version of) Flappy Bird
	* This is an iOS game
	* Uses
