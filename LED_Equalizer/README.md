######Audio Spectrum Analyzer LED Display

###Tiva C Series Launchpad Microcontroller Project
###IDE Energia

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired from a microcontrollerâ€™s 
course curriculum by designing and implementing a microcontroller-based embedded system project. The goal 
of this project was to use the microcontroller to create an audio spectrum analyzer with a LED display.

Summary of Materials Needed:
* Over 150 generic LEDs (There were green, dim yellow/red, and red LEDs)
* 3 Bread Board
* Several Wires
* Grove Sound Sensor
