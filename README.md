# MyCodingProjects
##A collection of some small coding projects I've built.

######Thanks for checking out my projects!

The first two projects are both microcontroller projects.
They were programmed, built, and techincal documents were written for each project in about 2 to 3 hours. 

####The RGB LED Rainbow 
	* This is a project used to teach kids between the ages 8 to 16 about STEM.
	* Uses an Ardunio Uno as an AVR In System Programmer
	* Uses an ATtiny45 8-pin IC to program RGB LEDs

####The LED Equalizer
	* This is a audio spectrum analyser
	* Uses a Tiva C Series, a sound sensor, and a ton of LEDs
	* Uses threshold values and interrupts to reflect auditory levels 

####The Orca ROV
	* Videos for the first prototype can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azRQuNWb_g)
	* Created a commercially affordable remotely operated underwater vehicle 
	* The ROV is fully customizable
	* GUI with information about:
		* Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Depth, and Temperature Sensors
		* Camera w/ Live Stream and Video Capture

####Will be updating with more past projects
